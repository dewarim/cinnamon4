# Cinnamon X

An experimental (hence the X) implementation of the Cinnamon 3 CMS server in Java.

This may or may not result in Cinnamon 4.


## Goal

Try to implement the core features of the Cinnamon CMS in Java, 

* using modern language features
* with unit tests
* with integration tests
* with documentation
* improved API
* removing obsolete code
* minimizing dependencies on huge frameworks which are hard to understand
* opinionated implementation (using Jetty, PostgreSQL, MyBatis). 

## License

None - yes, it's open source, but it is not finished and I have not chosen a license, so you cannot use it yet.
