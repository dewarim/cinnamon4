## LifecycleStateConfig

LifecycleStateConfig is currently stored as an XML string in the lifecycle_states table.
It is de-serialized to an object via LifecycleState.getLifecycleStateConfig().

Format is

[source,xml]
---
 <config>
   <properties><property><name>aclName</name><value>reviewers.acl</value></property></properties>
   <nextStates><stateName>published</stateName></nextStates>
 </config>
---

Options for refactoring are:

* move properties into their own table
** advantage: easier for CRUD operation / configure via GUI
** disadvantages: one more table, needs DAO
* move nextStates into a table.
** advantage: easier for CRUD, ensure referential integrity (cannot configure non-existant states)
** disadvantage: -

It could be interesting to have dynamically calculated nextStates,
but a viable alternative would be to have exitState/enterState to check if the given nextState is
really valid and present an error message if not.
