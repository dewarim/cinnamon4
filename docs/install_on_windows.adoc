== Install Cinnamon on a Windows Machine

=== Database

* Download the current stable version of https://www.postgresql.org/download/[PostgreSQL]
* Run the installer
* Start the pgadmin tool
* Add a user "cinnamon" with password "cinnamon" (you may use any username and password, but need to set it later in the configuration file if you do not use these default values )
* Grand login privileges to user cinnamon
* Create a database "cinnamon_test", owned by user "cinnamon"

TODO: describe a production installation

=== Java

* Download https://adoptopenjdk.net/[Java 16] (or 17, once available)
* Run the installer
* If the installer offers to add Java to the PATH variable, activate this option.
* Continue with configuration

=== Development

* Download and install Git: https://git-scm.com/downloads[Git]
* Download https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi[Apache Maven 3.8.1] (just use the zip archive)
* Unpack Maven to a folder.
* Add the Java and Maven executables on your PATH. Look at this https://stackoverflow.com/a/41895179[Stackoverflow answer]. (It's possible that the adopt-jdk install already did this for Java)
* Start the command line interface and check that both Java and Apache Maven have been installed correctly:

    java -version
    mvn -version

* Checkout the project via git shell:

    git clone git@github.com:dewarim/cinnamon4.git
