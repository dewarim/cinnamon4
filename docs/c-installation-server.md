# Installation instructions

## Summary
A Cinnamon server machine needs to host the Cinnamon server Java application with its dependencies. The server can run without any other peripheral applications and execute API commands. 

There are, however, some additional applications providing services that are not part of the core server but are required in many types of applications. 
These applications are not part of this GitHub repository, but another one named [cinnamon4-clients](https://github.com/boris-horner/cinnamon4-clients).
They must be installed separately, typically on the server itself, but they may run on other machines if required.

## Installing Cinnamon 4 server
Cinnamon 4 Server can run on Linux or Windows. Other operating systems with compatible Java and Postgres versions available may also work, but this is untested.
